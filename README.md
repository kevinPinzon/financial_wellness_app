# Financial Wellness App

## Overview

The **Financial Wellness App** is a Flutter-based application designed to help users evaluate their financial health. The app allows users to input their annual income and monthly costs, calculate their financial score, and provide a personalized assessment based on their financial well-being.

## Features

- **Financial Score Calculation:** Users can input their annual income and monthly costs to receive a financial wellness score.
- **Localized in Multiple Languages:** The app is localized in English and Spanish to cater to a diverse user base.
- **BLoC Pattern:** State management is handled using the BLoC pattern to separate business logic from UI code.
- **Custom Input Fields:** The app provides a customized input field for entering financial data, including a money formatter.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to be responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and web platforms.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter:** The app is built using Flutter, a popular open-source framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **BLoC:** State management is handled using the BLoC pattern to separate business logic from UI code.
- **GoRouter:** For handling routing and navigation.
- **GetIt:** Dependency injection to manage app-wide dependencies.
- **intl:** For localization and internationalization support.
- **flutter_svg:** For rendering SVG images.

### Folder Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **lib/**
  - **core/**: Contains utility classes, dependency injection setup, and common resources like images and colors.
  - **feature/**: The feature-specific code for financial calculations and the presentation layer.
  - **l10n/**: Localization files for supporting multiple languages (English and Spanish).
- **assets/**: Contains images and icons used throughout the app.

### Localization

The app supports English and Spanish. The localization files are located in `lib/l10n/`, and translations are automatically generated using the `flutter_intl` package.

### Dependencies

- **flutter_bloc:** A package for managing app state using the BLoC pattern.
- **flutter_svg:** To display SVG images.
- **get_it:** For dependency injection.
- **go_router:** For handling routing and navigation.
- **intl:** For internationalization and date formatting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK 3.5.4 or later
- Dart SDK 3.5.4 or later
- Dependencies listed in the `pubspec.yaml`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial_wellness_app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd financial_wellness_app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Run the app:
   ```bash

   ```

## How It Works

1. **User Input:** 
   - Users enter their **Annual Income** and **Monthly Costs**.
   - The app validates the input to ensure it is in the correct format.

2. **Financial Score Calculation:**
   - The app uses the formula defined in the `CalculateFinancialScore` class to calculate the financial score:
     - If monthly costs are less than or equal to 25% of annual income, the score is **Healthy**.
     - If monthly costs are less than or equal to 75%, the score is **Medium**.
     - Otherwise, the score is **Low**.

3. **Displaying Results:**
   - Based on the calculated score, users see a corresponding result page with a progress bar showing their financial health.
   - The result page provides a congratulatory message if the score is "Healthy", a suggestion for improvement if "Medium", and a cautionary message if "Low".

## App Screens

1. **Welcome Screen:**
   - Shows a welcome message and the app logo.

2. **Financial Status Form:**
   - Users input their financial data here.

3. **Result Page:**
   - Displays the financial wellness score along with a progress indicator and a detailed message based on the score.
